		I argue that aliens don't actually exist. However, I could be convinced if there were any real forms of evidence given. Most information including pictures and video "Evidence" can be proven fake. The given "evidence" that isn't fake can usually be marked off as a plane, helicopter, or shooting star. These blatantly fake pictures and videos often convince people that aliens are real. This poorly photoshopped image is an example of some of the "evidence" that has tricked parts of the media to convince others that aliens are real.

		Most people that insist aliens are real, usually go with the arguement that the government is hiding the aliens from the rest of the world. These people are delusional, because there are much more reasons to reveal to the world that aliens exist than reasons not to. The government could gain support to work with aliens if they are friendly, or gain support against the aliens if they are here with bad intentions. The only real reason the government would hide aliens from us is if they were working with the aliens against the public, which is just getting into crazy false conspiracy theories.
